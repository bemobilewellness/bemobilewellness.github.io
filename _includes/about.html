                <p>
                  I am fortunate enough to have found my passion at 19 years old in Massage Therapy, which led to my Yoga certification,
                  then Stand-up Paddleboard certification. Ecstatic about being my own boss for 2 years,
                  I must mention that I have 2 outstanding companies who use Massage and Yoga on regular basis,
                  as a complimentary service to their employees, 2 marvelous team members and never-ending opportunities in my future!
