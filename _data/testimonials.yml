  text: Iâ€™ve been seeing Vanessa now for more than three months and always look forward to our appointments. She is great in helping to work out my sore spots, of which there are always plenty (thank you Crossfit!). She has a magical way of relieving my aches in a short period of time. And since she is also knowledgeable on personal training, she has given me helpful tips on stretches that I can easily do at my desk to reduce tension.

  text: We use Vanessa as a corporate massage and yoga specialist at Apttus. We recently doubled the amount of time she is at our corporate office because of feedback and demand from team members. As a fast growth company this type of employee benefit not only improves retention, but also reduces stress and tension. She has very competitive rates - for both regular office visits as well as one time team spiffs - and is always on time and professional. I would highly recommend organizations consider Vanessa for massage.I also must comment that I am personally impressed by her service, and look forward to her time in the office. She is one of the most talented massage therapists I have ever experienced.

  text: Vanessa has been coming to Apttus since August 2012. I work out 7 days a week - boxing, running, soccer, swimming, cycling and her techniques and ability to massage specific areas of tension enable me to continue my work in a more relaxed state. I look forward to the days when Vanessa is here at Apttus because I know I will feel refreshed when I return to my work.
